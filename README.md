# subdomains
First write how many numbers you want to enter.
Then enter the numbers in order.
Then it will find the subdomains. 
Subdomains will only consist of consecutive numbers, for example, if numbers are {1,2,3}, {1,3} cannot be a subdomain.
Will then print how many subdomains the sum of their elements is negative.
